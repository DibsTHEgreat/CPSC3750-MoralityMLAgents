# CPSC3750-MoralityMLAgents

Hello, welcome to my final project for CPSC3750: Artificial Intelligence. This project is a collaborative effort between JP and me. In our project repo, we have a folder labeled “MoralityMLAgents” which contains our Unity project and a basic installation guide to recreate our project. In our “ProjectPaperWork” we have key milestone submissions for our project. If you’re interested in learning the conceptual side of our project, please feel free to take a look at our work.
